## ACADEMIC PROJECTS: 

### Resurgence of NYC Yellow Cab Taxis using Python  (Aug,2018 - Dec,2018)                                                                                     
- Tools & Techniques: PySpark, XGBoost, SparkML, Decision Tree, Gradient boosting, PCA, Decision Tree, Regression
- Leverage the NYC Yellow cab data from Kaggle by extracting features and by building a predictive model to assist Yellow Cab drivers by providing a pre-trip estimate of approximate duration and price. Tuned model parameters to achieve maximum accuracy without overfitting data. Rmse gradient boosting: ~$1.71178 for amount & total duration: ~87.31 sec. Accuracy (XGBoost) for duration: 67.9% & total amount: 63% 

### Demystifying Customer Satisfaction for a Hotel using R    (Jan,2018 - May,2018)                                                                   
- Tools & Techniques: R, Linear Regression, SVM, Naïve Bayes, Association Rules
- Analyzed data patterns in (~1.7 M) customer survey responses for a multinational hotel chain & produced actionable insights through predictive analysis for hotel’s performance across the globe by modelling key factors (KPI drivers) impacting customer's likelihood to recommend & improving Net Promoter Score
